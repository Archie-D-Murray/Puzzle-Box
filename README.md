## Theme
Game made in a week with the theme of 'Puzzle Box'. Not being a fan of puzzle games, I chose to 
instead implement a signal system where various objects like levers, buttons and pressure plates
could emit a 'signal' to activate/deactivate other objects like moving platforms, doors, etc

## Controls
- WASD to move
- E to interact
